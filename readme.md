## Data Models

1. **User**:
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `firstName`: User's first name
   - `lastName`: User's last name
   - `email`: User's email address
   - `password`: Hashed password
   - `gender`: gender of user
   - `age`: age of user
   - `skill`: skills of user

2. **Match**:
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `byuser`: ID of the first user
   - `touser`: ID of the second user
   - `status`: Match status (e.g., pending, accepted)

## API Endpoints

- **User Login**: `POST /login`
- **User logout**: `POST /logout`
- **Get User Profile**: `GET /profile/veiw`
- **Update User Profile**: `PATCH /profile/edit`
- **Update User Password**: `PATCH /profile/editpassword`

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**:
   - A new user submits their details via the registration form.
   - The server validates the input and creates a new user record in the database with a hashed password.

2. **User Login**:
   - The user provides their email and password.
   - The server verifies the credentials and, upon success, issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authenticated sessions.

3. **Browsing Profiles**:
   - Authenticated users request a list of potential matches.
   - The server retrieves user profiles from the database based on the requesting user's preferences and exclusion criteria (e.g., already matched or rejected users).

4. **Matching**:
   - When a user expresses interest in another user (e.g., swipes right), the server checks if there's a reciprocal interest.
   - If both users are interested, a new match record is created, and both users are notified.

## Authentication

Authentication is managed using JWTs. Upon successful login, the server issues a token that the client includes in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests. The token is validated on the server to ensure secure access to protected routes.

## Error Handling

The application follows a structured error-handling approach:

- **Validation Errors**: If a request contains invalid data, the API returns a `400 Bad Request` response with error details.
- **Authentication Errors**: If an invalid or missing token is provided, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- **Authorization Errors**: If a user tries to access resources they donâ€™t own, the API returns a `403 Forbidden` response.
- **Server Errors**: Unhandled exceptions result in a `500 Internal Server Error` response, logged for debugging.
